Single object mixins
====================

SingleObjectMixin
-----------------

.. class:: django.views.generic.detail.SingleObjectMixin

    Provides a mechanism for looking up an object associated with the
    current HTTP request.

    **Methods and Attributes**

    .. attribute:: model

        The model that this view will display data for. Specifying ``model
        = Foo`` is effectively the same as specifying ``queryset =
        Foo.objects.all()``, where ``objects`` stands for ``Foo``â€™s
        :ref:`default manager <default-managers>`.

    .. attribute:: queryset

        A ``QuerySet`` that represents the objects. If provided, the value of
        ``queryset`` supersedes the value provided for :attr:`model`.

        .. warning::

            ``queryset`` is a class attribute with a *mutable* value so care
            must be taken when using it directly. Before using it, either call
            its :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.all` method or
            retrieve it with :meth:`get_queryset` which takes care of the
            cloning behind the scenes.

    .. attribute:: slug_field

        The name of the field on the model that contains the slug. By default,
        ``slug_field`` is ``'slug'``.

    .. attribute:: slug_url_kwarg

        The name of the URLConf keyword argument that contains the slug. By
        default, ``slug_url_kwarg`` is ``'slug'``.

    .. attribute:: pk_url_kwarg

        The name of the URLConf keyword argument that contains the primary key.
        By default, ``pk_url_kwarg`` is ``'pk'``.

    .. attribute:: context_object_name

        Designates the name of the variable to use in the context.

    .. attribute:: query_pk_and_slug

        .. versionadded:: 1.8

        If ``True``, causes :meth:`get_object()` to perform its lookup using
        both the primary key and the slug. Defaults to ``False``.

        This attribute can help mitigate `insecure direct object reference`_
        attacks. When applications allow access to individual objects by a
        sequential primary key, an attacker could brute-force guess all URLs;
        thereby obtaining a list of all objects in the application. If users
        with access to individual objects should be prevented from obtaining
        this list, setting ``query_pk_and_slug`` to ``True`` will help prevent
        the guessing of URLs as each URL will require two correct,
        non-sequential arguments. Simply using a unique slug may serve the same
        purpose, but this scheme allows you to have non-unique slugs.

        .. _insecure direct object reference: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A4-Insecure_Direct_Object_References

    .. method:: get_object(queryset=None)

        Returns the single object that this view will display. If ``queryset``
        is provided, that queryset will be used as the source of objects;
        otherwise, :meth:`get_queryset` will be used. ``get_object()`` looks
        for a :attr:`pk_url_kwarg` argument in the arguments to the view; if
        this argument is found, this method performs a primary-key based lookup
        using that value. If this argument is not found, it looks for a
        :attr:`slug_url_kwarg` argument, and performs a slug lookup using the
        :attr:`slug_field`.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.8

            When :attr:`query_pk_and_slug` is ``True``, ``get_object()`` will
            perform its lookup using both the primary key and the slug.

    .. method:: get_queryset()

        Returns the queryset that will be used to retrieve the object that
        this view will display. By default, :meth:`get_queryset` returns the
        value of the :attr:`queryset` attribute if it is set, otherwise
        it constructs a :class:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet` by calling
        the ``all()`` method on the :attr:`model` attribute's default manager.

    .. method:: get_context_object_name(obj)

        Return the context variable name that will be used to contain the
        data that this view is manipulating. If :attr:`context_object_name` is
        not set, the context name will be constructed from the ``model_name``
        of the model that the queryset is composed from. For example, the model
        ``Article`` would have context object named ``'article'``.

    .. method:: get_context_data(**kwargs)

        Returns context data for displaying the list of objects.

        The base implementation of this method requires that the ``object``
        attribute be set by the view (even if ``None``). Be sure to do this if
        you are using this mixin without one of the built-in views that does so.

    .. method:: get_slug_field()

        Returns the name of a slug field to be used to look up by slug. By
        default this simply returns the value of :attr:`slug_field`.

    **Context**

    * ``object``: The object that this view is displaying. If
      ``context_object_name`` is specified, that variable will also be
      set in the context, with the same value as ``object``.

SingleObjectTemplateResponseMixin
---------------------------------

.. class:: django.views.generic.detail.SingleObjectTemplateResponseMixin

    A mixin class that performs template-based response rendering for views
    that operate upon a single object instance. Requires that the view it is
    mixed with provides ``self.object``, the object instance that the view is
    operating on. ``self.object`` will usually be, but is not required to be,
    an instance of a Django model. It may be ``None`` if the view is in the
    process of constructing a new instance.

    **Extends**

    * :class:`~django.views.generic.base.TemplateResponseMixin`

    **Methods and Attributes**

    .. attribute:: template_name_field

        The field on the current object instance that can be used to determine
        the name of a candidate template. If either ``template_name_field``
        itself or the value of the ``template_name_field`` on the current
        object instance is ``None``, the object will not be used for a
        candidate template name.

    .. attribute:: template_name_suffix

        The suffix to append to the auto-generated candidate template name.
        Default suffix is ``_detail``.

    .. method:: get_template_names()

        Returns a list of candidate template names. Returns the following list:

        * the value of ``template_name`` on the view (if provided)
        * the contents of the ``template_name_field`` field on the
          object instance that the view is operating upon (if available)
        * ``<app_label>/<model_name><template_name_suffix>.html``
